# WP Referral Code Plugin

WP Referral Code is a WordPress plugin that generates a unique referral code for each user, enabling users to start their own version of referral marketing.

Upon user registration, the plugin captures the referral code automatically. Additionally, WP Referral Code provides a user-friendly "copy refer link box" that allows users to easily copy and share their referral link.

This plugin has no dependencies other than the WordPress core and can be used with all other plugins. However, the logic after successful referral registration is up to you. Two important hooks are provided to help with this. Please check the [documentation](http://shalior.ir/wp-referral-code) on the plugin website for more information.

Several shortcodes are available to help you place things where they need to be. A list of these shortcodes can be found in the plugin options.

All information related to the referral status of a user can be found on the user edit page (Dashboard->Users->select a user). Here, you can view how many users the user has invited and who they were referred by.
